# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in Optio, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.
2. Report the issue through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting flow for
   `jtorelli-metalworks/optio` when available, or contact the repository owner
   privately with:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
3. You will receive an acknowledgment as soon as practical.
4. We will work with you to understand the issue and coordinate a fix before any public disclosure.

We ask that you give us reasonable time to address the issue before disclosing it publicly.

## Current Security Posture

### No Authentication (by design, for now)

**The Optio web UI and API have no authentication or authorization.** All endpoints are open and accessible to anyone who can reach the network.

This is a known limitation documented in the project roadmap. Optio is currently intended for use on **trusted networks only** — local development machines, private VPNs, or internal clusters where network-level access controls are already in place.

**Do not expose Optio to the public internet without adding an authentication layer in front of it.**

### Encryption at Rest

Secrets stored in the database (e.g., API keys, tokens) are encrypted using **AES-256-GCM** with a configurable encryption key. Each secret has its own initialization vector (IV) and authentication tag. The encryption key is provided at deployment time via the `encryption.key` Helm value or the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable.

### Agent Execution

Agents (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex) run inside isolated Kubernetes pods with git worktrees. Each task gets its own worktree within a shared repo pod. The pods run with a dedicated ServiceAccount that has RBAC-scoped permissions limited to pod and exec operations within the Optio namespace.

Claude Code runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, which means the agent has full access to the filesystem and can execute arbitrary commands within the pod. This is necessary for the agent to function but means you should treat the pod environment as untrusted after agent execution.

## Production Deployment Recommendations

If you plan to deploy Optio beyond a local development environment, consider the following hardening measures:

### Authentication and Authorization

- Add **JWT or OAuth 2.0** authentication to the API server (e.g., via a Fastify plugin or reverse proxy)
- Use an identity provider (Auth0, Okta, Keycloak) for user management
- Implement role-based access control to restrict who can create tasks, manage repos, and view secrets

### Network Security

- Deploy behind a **reverse proxy** (nginx, Traefik, Caddy) that handles TLS termination
- Use **Kubernetes NetworkPolicies** to restrict pod-to-pod traffic within the cluster
- Restrict API and WebSocket access to known IP ranges or VPN connections
- Enable TLS for PostgreSQL and Redis connections

### Secrets Management

- Use a dedicated secrets manager (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager) instead of the built-in encrypted-at-rest storage for high-sensitivity credentials
- Rotate the encryption key periodically
- Never log or expose secret values — Optio already enforces this in code, but verify in your deployment

### Kubernetes Hardening

- Run agent pods with a **read-only root filesystem** where possible
- Set resource limits (CPU, memory) on agent pods to prevent resource exhaustion
- Use **Pod Security Standards** (restricted or baseline) for the Optio namespace
- Limit the ServiceAccount permissions to the minimum required
- Consider using a container runtime sandbox (gVisor, Kata Containers) for agent pods

### Monitoring and Auditing

- Enable audit logging for the Kubernetes API server
- Monitor the `task_events` and `pod_health_events` tables for anomalous activity
- Set up alerts for failed tasks, crashed pods, and unusual agent behavior
- Review agent-generated PRs before merging — do not blindly auto-merge in production

### Supply Chain

- Pin container image versions in the Helm chart rather than using `latest`
- Scan agent images for vulnerabilities before deployment
- Use a private container registry with image signing

## Supported Versions

Optio is pre-1.0 software. Security fixes will be applied to the latest release only. There is no long-term support for older versions at this time.
